                    Amy McInturff is a Brisbane-based performer, specialising in dance, choreography, and performance.
                </span>

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Brisbane-based Amy McInturff is a well-rounded performer that specialises in dance and choreography. Amy's dance training includes Jazz, Commercial, Theatre, Jazz Funk, Contemporary, Ballet and Pas De Deux and is currently developing her skills in Hip Hop, Acro and Aerial to extend the possibilities of future work. In 2018, Amy acquired a Diploma of Musical Theatre from RAW Dance Company and since then has continued her training at Mad Dance House as well as internationally at Broadway Dance Center and Steps on Broadway. In 2022 Amy was selected to join the company of Pink Matter, Directed by Wanida Serce. Amy is currently in her 4th year at the Queensland University of Technology, studying for a Bachelor of Creative Industries and a Bachelor of business which has guided her entrepreneurial skills required within the Dance Industry.

                    Amy's commitment to her dance career is exemplified in her continuous dedication to training, always giving her absolute best. Her dedication is especially apparent when working in team settings, inspiring and encouraging others with her energetic personality. 

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

    
                    Training internationally ignited Amy's passion for dance, since returning from NYC for the third time in 2022 she is mindfully exercising the lessons and techniques she learnt from her training abroad in her daily class settings. Amy believes that being successful within this industry is strongly tied to goal setting and specific training for that role/contract. One of her short-term goals in the next year is to secure a dancer or dancer/singer cruise contract, travelling the world whilst performing to audiences every night. Her long-term goals are to join the company of Cirque Du Soleil, specifically performing in their Mad Apple show, allowing her to utilise her Jazz Funk and Commercial skills.
